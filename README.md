# Eternal Spring

Eternal Spring, is a cool unity farming game involving cute bunnies. The goal is to farm plants and sell them to the market.

## But, why?

Good question! I was bored and my eldest son loves to help me build stuff on the computer. Normally I build all sorts of microservice or machine-learning projects.
I decided that vacation is good for some fun and we should build something else together. Games are a great way for kids to learn more about computers. We're having
a ton of fun building our game.

So do we need a good reason? I think not :-)

## Getting started

Make sure you have the latest version of Unity on your machine and a code editor like VSCode, Visual Studio 2022, or Rider.
Next, clone this repository to your machine and open it in Unity. Have fun!

## Pull requests

We don't accept pull requests, simply because it's a learning thing.
