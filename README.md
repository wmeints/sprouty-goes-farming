## :shrug: But, why?

Good question! I was bored and my eldest son loves to help me build stuff on
the computer. Normally I build all sorts of microservice or machine-learning
projects. I decided that vacation is good for some fun and we should build
something else together. Games are a great way for kids to learn more about
computers. We're having a ton of fun building our game.

So do we need a good reason? I think not :-)

## :rocket: Getting started

Make sure you have the latest version of Unity on your machine and a code editor
like VSCode, Visual Studio 2022, or Rider. Next, clone this repository to your
machine and open it in Unity. Have fun!

## :merge: Pull requests

We accept pull requests for bug fixes. Feature enhancements are welcome too, but
we're a bit more restrictive there :-)
