# Sprouty goes farming

Sprouty goes farming, is a cool unity farming game involving cute bunnies. 
The goal is to farm plants and sell them to the market.

## :shrug: But, why?

Good question! I was bored and my eldest son loves to help me build stuff on
the computer. Normally I build all sorts of microservice or machine-learning
projects. I decided that vacation is good for some fun and we should build
something else together. Games are a great way for kids to learn more about
computers. We're having a ton of fun building our game.

So do we need a good reason? I think not :-)

## :rocket: Getting started

Make sure you have the latest version of Unity on your machine and a code editor
like VSCode, Visual Studio 2022, or Rider. Next, clone this repository to your
machine and open it in Unity. Have fun!

## :book: Learn more!

I've made a series of blogposts about this project on my website:

I'll be adding more posts here as they get published.

## :pencil: Pull requests

We accept pull requests for bug fixes. Feature enhancements are welcome too, but
we're a bit more restrictive there :-)
